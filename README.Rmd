# ssdca

`ssdca` is an R package to fit distributions to Species Sensitivity Data.
It is being developed for the B.C. Ministry of Environment by [Poisson Consulting](https://github.com/poissonconsulting).

## Installation

To quickly install the latest version:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcgov/ssdca")
```

To install the latest version and build its vignette:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcgov/ssdca", force = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

To view the vignette
```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("ssdca")
```

## Introduction

`ssdca` loads `fitdistrplus` and `ggplot2`, both of which it extends, as well as several other packages.
```{r}
library(ssdca)
```

`ssdca` provides a data set for several chemicals including Boron.
```{r}
boron_data
```

Multiple distributions can be fit using `ssd_fit_dists()`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
boron_dists <- ssd_fit_dists(boron_data)
```

and plot using the `ggplot2` generic `autoplot`
```{r}
theme_set(theme_bw()) # set plotting theme
autoplot(boron_dists)
```

The goodness of fit can be assessed using `ssd_gof`
```{r}
ssd_gof(boron_dists)
```

and the model-averaged 5% hazard concentration estimated using `ssd_hc`
```{r}
ssd_hc(boron_dists)
```

Model-averaged predictions complete with confidence intervals can be produced using the `stats` generic `predict`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
boron_pred <- predict(boron_dists)
```

and plotted together with the original data using `ssd_plot`.
```{r}
ssd_plot(boron_data, boron_pred, shape = "Group", color = "Group", label = "Species",
         xlab = "Concentration (mg/L)")
```

For more information and examples of how to use `ssdca` in conjuction with `fitdistrplus` to
assess alternative fits and deal with weighted and censored data see the vignette `ssdca`.
The vignette also demonstrates how to use `ssdca` in conjunction with `ggplot2` to produce custom plots.

A shiny webpage that was developed by [Seb Dalgaro](https://github.com/sebdalgarno) of Poisson Consulting for non-users of R is available at <https://poissonconsulting.shinyapps.io/ssdca-shiny/>.
