Title: Species Sensitivity Distributions
Description: Species sensitivity distributions are cumulative probability 
  distributions which are fitted to toxicity concentrations for multiple species.
  The ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to fit
  log-normal, log-logistic, log-gumbel, gompertz, gamma or weibull distributions.
  Multiple distributions can be averaged using Information Criteria.
  Confidence intervals on fits and hazard concentrations 
  are produced by bootstrapping.
